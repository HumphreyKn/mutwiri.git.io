                Power BI is an interactive <span id="newspan">data visualization</span> software product developed by Microsoft with a primary focus on <span class="newspan">business intelligence</span>  
                . It is part of the <span class="newspan">Microsoft Power Platform</span>. Power BI is a collection of software services, apps, and 
                connectors that work together to turn unrelated sources of data into coherent, visually immersive, and interactive insights. 
                Data may be input by reading directly from a database, webpage, or structured files such as spreadsheets, CSV, XML, and JSON. <br>
                Save time and make data prep easier with <span class="newspan">data modelling tools</span>. Reclaim hours in your day using the self-service Power Query 
                experience familiar to millions of <a href="#">Excel</a>  users. Ingest, <a href="#">transform,</a>  integrate, and enrich data in Power BI.

            <div>
                <a href="#">Power BI</a>  provides cloud-based BI (business intelligence) services, known as "Power BI Services", along with a desktop-based 
                interface, called "Power BI Desktop". It offers <span class="newspan">data warehouse</span> capabilities including <span class="newspan">data preparation, data 
                discovery, and <a href="#">interactive dashboards</a> </span>. In March 2016, Microsoft released an additional service called 
                Power BI Embedded on its Azure cloud platform. One main differentiator of the product is the ability to 
                load custom visualizations.
